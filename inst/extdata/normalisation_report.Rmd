This report was automatically generated by [DIANE](https://oceanecsn.github.io/DIANE) to improve research reproducibility.

It contains the main settings and results for the chosen tab of the application.

# Your data

The organism you're studying :

```{r}
r$organism
```

Number of genes :

```{r}
nrow(r$raw_counts)
```

Experimental conditions :

```{r}
unique(r$conditions)
```

Design:

```{r}
r$design
```

# Settings

Prior removal of differentially expressed genes :

```{r}
input$prior_removal
```

Normalization method :

```{r}
input$norm_method
```

Number of genes before low counts removal :

```{r}
nrow(r$raw_counts)
```

Number of genes after low counts removal :

```{r}
nrow(r$normalized_counts)
```

The criteria for gene filtering was a sum of expression across all samples above:

```{r}
input$low_counts_filter
```

## Distribution visualization

For each condition, we can visualize the distributions of gene counts before normalization and low can removal, and after.

```{r viz_filter, fig.width=10, fig.height=12}
pre_process <- DIANE::draw_distributions(r$raw_counts, boxplot = FALSE) + ggplot2::ggtitle("Before")
post_process <- DIANE::draw_distributions(r$normalized_counts, boxplot = FALSE)+ ggplot2::ggtitle("After")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(pre_process, post_process, ncol = 2)

```

The distribution modes should be aligned, and the initial peak around low values should have disappeared.

## Summary

Raw TCC summary including the chosen pipeline, library sizes and normalization factors :

```{r}
if(input$norm_method != 'none') print(r$tcc) else print("No normalization factors were applied.")
```

# Exploratory analysis

## PCA

```{r, fig.width=16, fig.height=10}
DIANE::quick_pca(r$normalized_counts)
```
